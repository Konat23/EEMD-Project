## Abstract
One of the main challenges faced by medical image analysis algorithms is the reduced generalization capability due to differences between datasets used for development, and those used for external testing. In the automated analysis of mammograms for breast cancer research, this problem has been tackled by the incorporation of image pre-processing or feature post-processing harmonization techniques. This research aims to assess the impact of harmonization techniques on the performance of machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk assessment.
We conduct a retrospective case-control study on 147 mammograms acquired with mammographic systems from two different vendors and consider the impact of harmonization techniques in three different experimental settings: 1) Intra-vendor, when both training and testing images are captured with systems from the same vendor, 2) Inter-vendor, when training and testing images are captured with systems from different vendors, and 3) Mixed-vendor when training and testing include images from both vendors. Our results show that image pre-processing can have a detrimental impact on performance in intra-vendor settings; the joint use of image pre-processing and feature pos-processing is beneficial in inter-vendor settings; and the mixed-vendor setting does not appear to be significantly affected by the harmonization.
